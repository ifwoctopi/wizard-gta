# Remember Event Position 1.0
#--------------------------------------------------
#
# Author: Shaz
#
# Description: This script lets you set the position and direction
#              where an event will appear next time the map is
#              loaded.  Events will appear in this new position
#              rather than the place they were put during design.
#
#--------------------------------------------------
#
# Installation: 
#
# Copy into a new script slot in the Materials section
#
#--------------------------------------------------
#
# Use:
#
# Examples below show syntax for an Event Command on an Event Tab.
#   You can use @event_id for the current event, or specify an event number.
# To execute from within a Set Move Route command, omit the
#   $game_map.events[@event_id]. part, and just use save_pos() and forget_pos().
#
# To tell an event to move to its current position the next time
# the map is loaded, execute the following in a script call:
#   $game_map.events[@event_id].save_pos()
#
# To tell an event to move to a particular position (not its
# current position) the next time the map is loaded,
# execute the following in a script call:
#   $game_map.events[@event_id].save_pos(1, 2, 8)
# - the above will move the event to x=1, y=2, facing up
#
# To tell an event to forget its previously remembered position
# and go back to its default position the next time time map
# is loaded, execute the following in a script call:
#   $game_map.events[@event_id].forget_pos()
